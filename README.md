# KS E-commerce Back End 

## Description

This program uses MYSQL to create a backend server to a database that displays data based on product, tag, or category. Students are expected to use their knowledge on MYSQL and databases to make the program functional. 

## Instailation

First, users must create a .env file containing the database name, as well as their username and password. Afterwards, follow the following steps to initialize the program.

1. Use MYSQL to initilize the database by running 'source schema.sql' while in the db folder and signed into MYSQL.
2. Run 'npm run seed' while in the root folder to seed the database.
3. Run 'npm start' to initilize the server. (Default server is 3001).
4. Use a program that tests api endpoints, such as Insomnia, to test GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST commands.


## Usage

The following video demonstartes how to start the application as well as some of the commands being tested through Insomnia.
